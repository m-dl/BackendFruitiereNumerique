The Hotel Ollier is one of the oldest hotels in the town and it is here that Albert Camus had often take meals under the name of "Sir Terrace" in order to remain incognito. He often came here with his friend Jules Roy among others, and lived there light moments full of laughter.

Camus discovered Lourmarin for the first time in 1936 when he came with his first wife in another attempt to reconcile their relationship, following Jean Grenier advice that described him the village as a "heavenly place". Unfortunately, the separation could be avoided some years later, despite this stay.

In 1940 he married Francine Faure, French-Algerian like him; they gave birth to twins (Jean and Catherine Camus) in 1945, just before the couple was temporarily separated during the Second World War. This event will give birth to his book "The Plague" in 1947, originally named "The Separated", telling the story of a separate Algerian couple in Oran, during a quarantine following a great episode of plague. We understood here that the plague is a metaphor that symbolizes the German occupation in France ...

So to speak, the first Camus stay in Lourmarin was a failure, but it did not prevent him to settle here a few years later with his wife and children, on the advice of his friend René Char, who managed to draw him in Provence, where he was living for years, in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue.

The Hotel Ollier was so important to Camus that he made there his Provençal "café de Flore" and enjoyed a coffee there with the Lourmarin football team to celebrate their victory or to drown their defeat on Sunday evenings !
