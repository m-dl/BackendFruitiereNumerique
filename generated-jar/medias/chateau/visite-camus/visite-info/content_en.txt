Albert Camus was born on November 7, 1913 in Mondovi, Algeria, where he spent a modest and difficult childhood in a popular neighborhood of Algiers, with his mother, illiterate and almost deaf and mute ; his grandmother who educated him very strictly ; and his older brother Lucien. He never knew his father, who died a year after his birth during the Battle of Marne.

It is thanks to his teacher Louis Germain that he will become aware of his writing skills and will get in a competition, a scholarship to enroll at the Bugeaud High school of Algiers, in which he discovered two passions: football and philosophy.
It is under the influence of his teacher and friend Jean Grenier - his "master" - that he will become a few years later, a writer, novelist, philosopher, playwright, essayist and talented novellist ; journalist and activist involved in the French Resistance and close to libertarian movements.

Jean Grenier teached him that writing should serve to express his doubts in order to assume it; The two men met in 1930 at the Bugeaud High school of Algiers, and it was during the absence of his pupil in the second half, because of his tuberculosis, that Jean Genier went to the home of Camus and finds the world inwhich he was living, which disoriented him forever and created a friendship of over twenty years.

But it is also reading "The Pain" of André de Richaud that Camus will become aware of the power of words and glimpsed "(...) the world of creation (...)" ("Essays" A. Camus - Gallimard edition, p 1111-1117)...

His works are based on humanism and awareness of "the absurd" of the human condition, as well as "the revolt" in response to this absurd, without supporting nor terrorism nor physical violence.

His positions are trenches, frank and bold, and he didn't hesitate to openly criticize Soviet totalitarianism and stand up against inequalities affecting North African Muslims and misconceptions that affecting feet-black.

He settled in France in 1939-1940, after being expelled from the Algerian journalism because of his accusers articles and reports in the newspaper "Alger Républicain" directed by his friend Pascal Pia. In 1942, he created an underground newspaper called "Combat" advocating the Resistance and in which he later denounced certain acts of the government in the postwar period, including the use of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.

It adheres very quickly to the Algerian and French Communist parties, which defended (apparently) the same values ​​that are his: the defense of the oppressed people and the anti-colonialism; but turneth few years later, by disappointment and even blur with his great friend Jean-Paul Sartre about it.

In 1957 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, which will allow him to buy his house in Lourmarin in 1958; town that he first discovered through the stories of his teacher Jean Grenier, who was very attached to this piece of Provencal paradise. He will come twice in Lourmarin before 1958 following the advice of his friends, but you will discover later in the visit, that these two experiments in the village did not let him good memories at this moment ...

It is tragically on January 4, 1960 iun Villeblevin (Yonne), while returning from Lourmarin by national 6 towards Paris, that he finds death in a car accident with his friend Michel Gallimard, who lose also his life of suites of this accident. Albert Camus is thus buried in the cemetery of Lourmarin, in this south land that reminded him his lost Algeria.
