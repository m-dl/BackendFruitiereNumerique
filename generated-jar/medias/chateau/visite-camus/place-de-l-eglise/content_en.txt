It is not far from the place of the church that is the house of Albert Camus, in which still live his daughter, Catherine. A former silk with green shutters and a rounded terrace was thus the last home of this great man, that residents and shopkeepers of the village much appreciated. Today the "Grand'Rue of the Church" has been renamed "Rue Albert Camus" in his honor.

It is thanks to René Char that Camus finally decided to buy a home in Provence; However, after the two failures he had lived by coming in Lourmarin in the past, he was looking for a home in l'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue reither than in Lourmarin. 

Indeed, the two men met for the first time at Gallimard's in 1946 and worked together on a project dealing with a collection of poems concerning the Resistance matter (dear theme to both men) called "sheets of Hypnos "; but Camus was already won long ago by the poems of the man who would become his confidant, his friend. The two men quickly appreciate and admire respectively the unity of the one and the other, in terms of speech, work and humanity. They will maintain a beautiful correspondence between 1946 and 1959 and Camus will write to Char on May 16, 1956: "Before to know you, I didn't care about poetry.".

Camus was always attracted by the South of France because this region reminded him his Algerian lands, and soon Jean Grenier, his teacher at the High school Bugeaud of Algiers, charmed him by its stories about Provence and Lourmarin that he believed to be a "Homeland". And when René Char took Camus for a walk in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, he saw in his eyes that he refinds his original lands, when he was contemplating together the Luberon, the Mont Ventoux and the Alpilles. Thus in 1946, Camus requested his friends (René Char and Jean Grenier) to find him a house in Provence in order to start his new life away from Paris and away from the image of "Just" it conveys to some communist circles and also to flee his friendly break with with Jean-Paul Sartre.

Nevertheless, it is only in 1958 that he finally found the house of his dreams, right here and he wrote to Jean Grenier: "I put my feet in yours" when he was speaking of his arrival in Lourmarin. He then committed some works to slightly turn the house with the help of Léonce Ginoux, a neighbor mason and César Raynaud, blacksmith and farrier in Lourmarin, which also contributed to building developments. Leonce's wife, Suzanne Ginoux, forty, already worked for the previous owners of the silkworm, and agreed to stay and work for the Camus family. Albert Camus regarded this woman as a sister and not as a simple housekeeper. Francine was also very close to her, she quickly became his confidante and helped her to get used to the house where she lived with Camus, not as a couple in love but in a kind of fraternal union, for their children .

However, the tranquility of Camus will be short-lived, since it will soon be disturbed by the events taking place in Algeria. Camus was supporting French Algeria and equality of the two communities. He wrote to Charles Poncet in 1955:.. "I am anxious for Algeria and I can not think of anything else (...) I have confidence in you, in any case, and this is why, at the risk of boring you, I send you this little SOS ".
But, he will never know the outcome of the war in Algeria since it will finish in 1962, two years after his tragic death.
