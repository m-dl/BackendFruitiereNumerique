The stadium of Lourmarin is brought to you during this visit because, as you know, Albert Camus was a hardcore football fan. From an early age he developed a passion for this sport in high school he attended in Algeria and discovered goalie talent in his RUA team.
Unfortunately affected by tuberculosis in 1930, his passion should be limited to participate in matches as a simple supporter...and that is why he was a fervent supporter of the JSL (Lourmarin's football team) and came regularly attend matches taking place on Sundays right here. He often took the time to drink a coffee with the entire team at the Hotel Ollier, at the end of the matches, and it's also the Lourmarin football players who have worn his body during his funeral.

When he was in his school in Algeria, Camus had often felt a social divide between his rich comrades and his own very modest family background: a poor neighborhood, an illiterated mother and housekeeper, a deceased father ... So football matches were a way for him to feel on equal terms with other students; he often make the link in his works between football stadiums and theater stages, where people abandons their personal condition in favor of pure fun of playing.

He wrote in "The Fall" (ed Gallimard - 1956.): "I was really sincere than when I played sports, and in the regiment, when I played in the performances that we represented for our pleasure . There was in both cases a rule of the game, which was not serious, and that we amused to respect. Even now, the Sunday matches in a stadium full of people, and the theater I liked with an unparalleled passion, are the only places where I feel innocent. ".
He also used to say that the only morality he knew, he had learned on a stadium or on theater stages.

When he played (at theater as in football), he felt a deep sense of hope and solidarity, that he did not feel necessarily elsewhere in society ...

Speaking of theater, it is necessary to remind that this art is the greatest passion that has known Camus during all his life. It is by reading Jacques Copeau that his taste for theater was born, as he liked his sense of quality and its rejection of making theater a commercial art; he felt also that " Copeau placed above all the text, the style, the beauty (...) " and that it was a before and an after Copeau. Inspired by this man, Camus launched into the creation of the "Théâtre de l'Equipe" in 1937 and played there any part of Copeau directory, while adapting to the vision of more contemporary authors like Malraux , for example.
