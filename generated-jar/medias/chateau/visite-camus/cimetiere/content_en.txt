Albert Camus is buried in the cemetery of Lourmarin. He died on January 4, 1960 in the Yonne department, while he was returning from Lourmarin to Paris by the National Road #6 after Christmas holidays. It is with his friend Michel Gallimard, that this great man lose his life, after the publisher have convinced him not to take the train and to come try his Facel Vega; the car that led them to death after being violently hit on a tree ... You should know that Camus hated the car speed and thought that it was "absurd" to be killed in "a crumpled sheet dress". Therefore he was very wary of motorists, and preferred the train to the car. Surely, he had reason to be suspicious...

A briefcase belonging to Camus was found at the scene of the accident, it contained an unfinished manuscript of his latest work "The First Man" in which he directed his autobiography and sets out to find the father he haven't known because he died a year after his birth following a head injury by shrapnel during the Battle of the Marne.

The last years of Camus's life were marked by the war in Algeria during which he largely defended the maintenance of French Algeria and the equality between the two communities. He also asked for a war truce with the support of many other French intellectuals, but this call will never be followed neither by France nor by Algeria. The war had ended in 1962, thus Camus never known the outcome of it.

Another event marked his last years: the Nobel Prize for literature he received in 1957 for "the whole of a work that highlights the problems facing today in the consciousness of men." During his speech in Sweden, he did not fail to pay a tribute to his teacher Louis Germain, who made him aware of his literary skills and allowed him to get his scholarship to the Bugeaud high school of Algiers. However, he remained convinced that other French authors could also receive that price, above all André Malraux. More, this award gave him the impression that people placed this "work" behind him, even though he placed it before him. He felt buried alive...

You could see that the grave of Albert Camus is very simple and modest, in his image, a simple and modest man but brave and talented.

Three days after his death, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a beautiful article in the newspaper " France Observateur" that was published on January 7, 1960 , in which he makes a tribute to Albert Camus, with whom he had " quarreled " several years ago. He considers there that "a quarrel is nothing " and reiterates its attachment to the man he thinks " being one of the main strengths of french cultural field and in his own way represent the history of France and the century. " He also talks about " the Absurd " that hit him when he was only twenty years (his illness) and the one that will definitely muted him : this accident, "a scandal " according to him.
