The castle of Lourmarin is not a castle like the others. After being restored by the intellectual Robert Laurent-Vibert in 1925 and bequeathed to a foundation wearing the same name, it was administered by several personalities, sucha as the talented writer Henri Bosco. This building thus received many prominent residents and has therefore seen passing great men such as Jules Roy, Jean Amrouche, the architect Henri Pacon, the sculptor Louis Dideron and even the writer Albert Camus, for a night...

Henri Bosco, who had participated in the restoration of the castle in the 1920s for his friend Robert Laurent-Vibert, officially became an administrator in 1941. Then, he spent a lot of time in the castle and in 1945, while he just received the Renaudot prize for his book "Le Mas Theotimus", he decided to invite some of his closed friends to celebrate this event. Thus an invitation has been sent by telegram to Jules Roy and Jean Amrouche, mutual friends of Bosco and Camus, and to Camus himself.
The telegram will not be answered for several months, until those firends came to Lourmarin, almost unexpectedly in September 1946. At that time, Bosco was busy with other works, and had no time to receive them, that is why he reserved them a cold and embarrassed reception and will make them pay for their stay in the castle! Robert YTIER bring in "Henri Bosco or Love of Life" in 1996, the Bosco words as follows: "You will naturally pay a daily allowance, everybody is compelled ... ourselves too ... and for each meal you'll feed in the village at your own expense, as a "popote" said the host with a faint smile to the stern face of The Captain Roy".

This nonchalant attitude displeased deeply to Camus who left the castle the next morning ; besides, when these two iconic characters were both in Lourmarin, they did not attend at all ...
 
Following this unfortunate event, Roy reported that "it was like if Bosco was falling from the moon " [ seeing them reach the castle ] and note about the fact that Bosco offered them nothing, " not even a pastis" that "Camus generous and hospitable to stupidity, was in an amazement that was felt sluggish eye when he thought about it".

Thus, one of the first experiences of Camus in Lourmarin was not a success either ; which led him in 1946 to seek a home around L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, rather than Lourmarin, in order to be cloed to his friend and confidant René Char.
