The Fountain of the Street Albert Camus, should actually carry the name of the "Fountain of the Cordière" because it is placed at the exact spot where was one of the gates of the village in the past, gates called "Cordieres"; that is why the hostel on the corner of Albert Camus and Henry De Savornin streets is called "Gite de la Cordière".

This fountain (with three other fountains of the village) was created in 1850 to allow the villagers to access to water more easily, while previous fountains were placed too far from certain quarters, including this one .
It must be remembered that at that time there was no running water in the houses (comes in 1947 in the village); and the fountains were a central and vital point to allow people to drink, wash, wash themselves, cook ... with the water that flowed there.
Proximity was thus necessary to prevent the women to travel hundreds of meters with heavy buckets in hand, until home.

A lion's muzzle was placed on the fountain as a tap, like on the other three fountains installed the same year (the Fountain of the Church, the fountain of the Sarret street and the old mill's one).
